This repository contains a demonstration of a common off-by-one error in COBOL loops. The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.  The error stems from an incorrect loop termination condition, leading to an inaccurate calculation. The solution demonstrates how to adjust the loop condition to accurately account for the desired number of iterations.
